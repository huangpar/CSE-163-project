# CSE-163-project

All files will be provided in the ZIP including datasets, you can also find datasets within the links on our report in the data section. Libraries and environments were referenced from CSE 163 software site including Anaconda and the environment.yaml for all Python packages.

data_processing.py is used for cleaning and sorting the datasets according to our project's scope. The functions include a sorting and filtering function for finding our popularity score and influence score. A merge function is also used to merge datasets together for the specifics of our research question.
game_popularity_analysis.py is used for aggregating and calculating our popularity and influence score using the datasets from data_processing.py. Developer analysis is also made in order to determine the popularity per employee score. All functions include plotted data based on our findings.
test.py confirms the validity of our game_popularity_analysis.py through multiple testing of our functions and other factors that help us understand the data better. 

Please change all relative paths to the datasets in order for our program to run according to where the datasets are located in the user's folder. Run the game_popularity_analysis.py file to see all of our correlation results and plots. If using Mac, you would need to close each visualization in order to see the next visualization from research question 1 to research question 3.
